# Code_Clause_Fake_News_Detection
In this data science idea, we will use python to build a model that can accurately detect whether a piece of news is real or fake. we'll build a TfidfVectorizer and use a PassiveAggressiveClassifier to classify news into "Real" and "Fake". We'll be using a dataset and execute everything in Jupyter lab.
